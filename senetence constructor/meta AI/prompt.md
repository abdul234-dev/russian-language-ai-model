-BAD: in clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs , the student nee to figure that out
-BAD: the sentence structure says too much we want really conceptual like this : [location] [subject] [verb], [object] [verb-past]?

Let's work through the transcription together.
Here's the vocabulary table:

|Russian	|Transliteration|	English
Медведи	    |Medvedi	        |Bears
Дверь	    |Dver	            |Door
Мусор	    |Musor	            |Garbage

Оставлять	Ostavat'sya	Leave
Вы	Vy	You

Possible sentence structure:
Sentence 1: Subject (Медведи) + linking verb + location (у двери)
Sentence 2: Question ( Did you leave...) + Verb (оставлять) + Object (мусор)
Clues to get you started:
"Bears are at the door" might use the phrase "у двери" to indicate location.
"Did you leave" is a question that requires a verb conjugation in the past tense.
Think about how to phrase "garbage out" in Russian - might use "на улице" or another prepositional phrase.
Your turn! Try to transcribe the sentence into Russian using the vocabulary and clues. I'll help you work through it.

**Vocabulary Table:**

| Russian | Transliteration | English |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| медведь | medved' | bear |
| дверь | dver' | door |
| оставлять | ostavlyat' | to leave |
| мусор | musor | garbage |
| ты | ty | you |

**Sentence Structure Hints:**

1. **First part**: "Bears are at the door"
   - Structure: [Subject] [location phrase] 
   - Think about plural forms and the prepositional case for location
   - Remember: Russian often omits the verb "to be" in present tense

2. **Second part**: "Did you leave the garbage out?"
   - Structure: [Question word] [subject] [past tense verb] [object] [directional phrase]?
   - This is a past tense question
   - Consider what case the direct object should be in
   - Think about the word for "out" in the context of putting something outside

**Grammar Clues:**
- You'll need to make "bear" plural
- Location "at the door" requires a specific preposition + case
- The question uses past tense
- "Garbage" will be a direct object
- "Out" here means "outside" - think about direction

Now try to construct the Russian sentences!
